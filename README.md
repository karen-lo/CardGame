# CardGame

Building a card game as a means to learn Ruby, and eventually Ruby on Rails.

Which card game you ask? That is a secret for now. Try guessing by taking a look at my code.

### TODO:

- triples as a choice

1. write a method to determine win condition + test
2. write method to prompt player for choice
3. write `play` in player.rb + test
